# NEPTUNE STORE MANAGER

## What is it?

Efficient and simple to use store manager, which enables you to create small slices to of data, accesible from anywhere in the app

## Motivation

The most decoupled react component is the one that has no props passed on. That means, we always prefer a component having 0 props if posible. To do so, we can make use of observable pattern which will contain the shared data between components.

Afterwards we realized that this could also work as a global storage manager, as it is really simple to use

## Why do you need this?

Global state in your app should be minimum.
